## Run it

Install the JavaScript dependencies once, then serve the web export from the
repository root:

```powershell
npm install
npm run lan
```

Open <http://localhost:8000>. The viewer must be served over HTTP; opening
`index.html` directly will not load its modules and binary assets.

`npm run lan` also prints a LAN address, and anyone on the same WiFi who opens
it joins the match. See [LAN multiplayer](#lan-multiplayer). A plain static
server still works if you only want single player:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000 --directory export/web
```

Controls:

- `WASD`: move; mouse: look
- `Shift`: sprint; `Space`: jump
- `C` or `Ctrl`: crouch; `B`: respawn
- `Left mouse`: fire; `R`: reload
- `Right mouse`: aim down sights
- `Tab`: hold the free-for-all scoreboard
- `N`: navmesh overlay; `V`: collision overlay
- `P`: find and draw a navmesh path to the point under the crosshair
- `Esc`: pause and release the mouse

On a phone or tablet, tap **Tap or click to load**, then tap to deploy once the
game is ready. Drag the left stick to walk and push it
fully forward to sprint. Swipe on the right to look; hold **FIRE** and drag it
to aim while shooting. **AIM** and **CROUCH** toggle, while **JUMP** and
**RELOAD** act on a tap. Aiming or firing automatically interrupts sprint.
The top-right buttons open scores and pause. The pause menu includes class
selection, saved look sensitivity, and optional full screen. Both orientations
work; landscape leaves more room around the controls.

Mobile graphics default to **Auto**, which starts at up to 1.5× resolution
and adjusts gradually to sustained frame times. **Performance** uses up to
1× resolution and disables edge smoothing; **Quality** uses up to 2× with
stronger texture filtering. Both Auto and Quality smooth the scene and weapon
edges using supported HDR multisampling, with FXAA as the fallback. Resolution
stays within pixel and GPU size limits. Choose a preset from the title or pause
menu; the selection is saved on the device.

## LAN multiplayer

`npm run lan` serves the game and runs a small relay beside it:

```
Claude of Duty — LAN server
  Local    http://localhost:8000
  LAN      http://192.168.1.42:8000   <- share this on the WiFi
```

Anyone on the same network who opens that address joins the same free-for-all.
Up to eight people; the six bots stay in the match as extra combatants, so a
two-player game still feels populated. Enter a name on the title screen and the
lobby shows who else is in.

No internet is needed. Three.js and Recast are served from `export/web/vendor`
rather than a CDN, so the WiFi does not need an uplink. Run `npm run vendor`
after changing those dependencies.

### How it works

One browser is elected **host** — the oldest connection — and it owns the bots
and the scoreboard. Everyone else replicates them. Every client owns its own
player. The server itself has no game rules; it assigns peer ids, keeps the
join order, and forwards messages.

Damage follows one rule:

> Damage is shooter-reported. Death is victim-confirmed. Scoring is
> host-recorded.

You raycast locally and announce the hit; the machine that owns the body
decides whether it died; the host is the only machine that writes the
scoreboard. This keeps your own spawn protection, regeneration and death timing
on your own machine, so a death never feels stolen. It also means the shooter
is trusted about whether a shot connected, which is the right trade among
people in one room and the wrong one on the open internet. Sanity checks
(per-weapon damage ceiling, rate, range) catch bugs, not adversaries.

Remote players are drawn with the bot rig — the same baked poses and the same
torso/head/legs hitboxes — so headshots on your friends work through the code
that already shipped. Bodies render 100 ms in the past, interpolated between
real snapshots, which at LAN latency looks exact.

The host keeps the bots and the match clock running even while sitting in its
own pause menu. Only that player is paused; the room is not. (Bot simulation
originally hung off the local player's own pause state, so the host pressing
Escape stopped the world for everybody else.)

If the host closes their tab, the next-oldest player is promoted and the match
continues. Everyone else keeps playing: the departed player's body and
scoreboard row are removed, scores are preserved, and the new host picks the
bots up from where they were replicated rather than snapping them to stale
navmesh agents. Expect a brief hitch as it takes over. If that player leaves
too, the next one is promoted, and so on.

A player who leaves keeps their entries in the kill feed -- that is a record of
what happened -- but drops off the standings, which list who is still playing.

### Playing with people who are not on your WiFi

`npm run relay` starts a relay: sockets only, no game assets, and it terminates
no TLS of its own. Put a tunnel in front and share the URL it prints:

```powershell
npm run relay
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8787
```

Players paste that address into the **Relay** tab of the multiplayer panel. The
first to arrive opens the room and is shown a four-character code; everyone else
is told a game is already running and types the code. Paste anything —
`https://…`, `http://…`, `wss://…`, `ws://…`, or a bare host — and it is
normalised for you.

The relay does not serve the game, so players still load the page from
somewhere: the public site, your own static host, or a local `npm run lan`. One
browser rule decides which relay addresses will work for them: **a page served
over HTTPS can only reach a `wss://` relay.** The game checks this before
opening the socket and says so, because the browser itself fails silently.

The code is a join secret, not an address — a relay holds one room at a time.
The room lives only while someone is in it; when the last player leaves it is
destroyed and the next arrival opens a fresh one with a new code.

**Two things to know before exposing a relay.** Whoever connects first owns it,
so a stranger who finds the URL while it is empty can occupy it and stop you
creating a game — which is why an unguessable tunnel hostname matters more than
it looks. And damage stays shooter-reported, so anyone in the room is trusted
about the shots they claim. Both are fine among friends and wrong for strangers.

Expect internet latency to land on the victim rather than the shooter. You hit
what you see; your friends occasionally die after they thought they had reached
cover. That is the trade this netcode makes, not a bug.

### A host that stops hosting

A slow host does not slow anyone else's game: guests keep their own frame rate,
and player-versus-player never touches the host — a hit goes shooter, server,
victim. Bot simulation is delta-time based, so a struggling host makes bot
motion coarser rather than slower.

A host that stops entirely is the real risk, because its socket stays perfectly
healthy and nothing else notices. The server therefore watches the host-only
channel: if the host has broadcast before and then goes quiet for six seconds
while somebody else is present, the role moves to the next-oldest player. A
host that has never broadcast is left alone, since a freshly joined one spends
a long time loading the map before its first `botState`.

A demotion sticks. When the old host recovers it comes back as a guest: it
stops simulating, starts replicating, and its bots snap to the new host's
truth. It cannot take the role back by simply resuming — the relay gates
host-only messages on its own record of who is host, so a recovered host's
`botState` is dropped rather than relayed, and there is never a window with two
hosts. Any scores it recorded while the room had moved on are discarded in
favour of the new host's scoreboard, which is what having a single authority
means. It regains the role only if the current host later leaves.

A player who actually disconnects and reconnects returns as a new peer with a
new id and a fresh score; reconnects do not preserve identity.

### One slow machine cannot slow the room

A stalled laptop stops draining its socket, and a relay that queued for it
would spend everyone's time on one client's backlog. Instead, state snapshots
are dropped to a congested peer — the next snapshot supersedes them anyway —
while events like hits and deaths are always delivered. A peer that falls
hopelessly behind is disconnected and left to reconnect cleanly.

### Testing it

`npm run ai:lan` boots the real server, opens two independent browsers, joins
both, stands them face to face, and asserts that each sees the other, that
damage crosses the wire, that the kill is scored, that both scoreboards agree,
and that closing the host promotes the survivor with the bots still running.
Artifacts land in `artifacts/ai-lan`.

`npm run ai:relay` covers the relay: a page server and a relay on separate
origins, two browsers, one opening a room and the other joining by code, with a
wrong code refused in between.

`npm run ai:lan3` runs the three-player case. It exists because a bystander --
the player who was neither the host nor the one promoted -- is where migration
actually breaks, and this caught a real bug: the server announces a departure
before it announces the new host, so the peer about to be promoted saw the old
host leave while still a guest, skipped dropping its combatant, and then
published a scoreboard that kept the departed player for the rest of the
match.

## Frontend

The viewer opens on a menu shell rather than a bare loading message. It has a
loading screen, a title screen, and an `Esc` pause menu, all sharing one set of
layers built from the game's own frontend art in `zone/all/ui_mp.ff`: the
`menu_mp_background_main2` backdrop, a scrolling `bg_fogscrollthin` strip, the
`menu_mp_background_glow` plate, and the `menu_mp_map_select_hijacked_final`
map card. The pause buttons and panel use `menu_button_backing` and
`menu_mp_lobby_frame_outer`.

Those plates ship white-on-alpha because the game tints them at runtime, so the
browser does the same through `mask-image`. The single `--fe-accent` custom
property in `index.html` recolours every panel, button, and glow at once; it is
set to the HUD's mint rather than the game's blue. The layout is not the
original: T6 menudefs do not dump (the Unlinker lists all 133 in `ui_mp.ff` and
writes none of them), so only the art is reused.

The load bar measures stages declared up front with fixed weights. The visible
map ships as one Meshopt-compressed GLB containing GPU-compressed KTX2 textures,
so its progress callback covers the dominant transfer. A stage is held below
its full weight until its promise settles, preventing the bar from reaching
100% before the game is playable.

Re-export the menu art with:

```powershell
python .tools/export_ui.py
```

It dumps `ui_mp.ff` and converts the dozen images the menu uses into
`export/web/ui/` (~1.4 MB), leaving the other 513 in the zone.

The original in-game HUD art is exported the same way into
`export/web/ui/hud/`:

```powershell
python .tools/export_hud.py
```

It dumps `common_mp.ff` and `mp_hijacked.ff` and converts everything matching
the HUD filters — compass ring, pings, and the `compass_map_mp_hijacked` radar
map, waypoints, killstreak and killfeed icons, fire-mode selectors, grenade
icons, damage feedback, and the low-health overlays (~2 MB). The HUD's layout
menudefs do not dump for T6, so the browser would rebuild placement itself and
draw with this art.

## Play counter

The title screen shows how many people have played, under the prompt:

```
3 PLAYERS · 8 PLAYS
```

Production is being migrated from Netlify to Cloudflare Pages. The Cloudflare
backend is `functions/api/plays.js`, with separate D1 databases for production
and branch previews so automated checks and preview visits cannot change the
public totals. `wrangler.jsonc` is the source of truth for those bindings.

Cloudflare cannot upload the bake inputs that live beside the runtime export:
some are unused and one exceeds Pages' per-file limit. The staging command
copies only the same runtime package Netlify publishes, without deleting files
from the working tree:

```powershell
npm run cloudflare:stage
npm run cloudflare:dev
```

Apply `migrations/0001_play_counter.sql` to both D1 databases once, then deploy
the staged package with `npm run cloudflare:deploy`. Branch deployments select
the preview database through `CF_PAGES_BRANCH`; only `main` uses the production
counter.

`players` counts browsers that have started a match, `plays` counts sessions
that have. The split is deliberate: `players` is the honest answer to "how many
people have played", and `plays` is the one that moves.

`export/web/play-counter.js` holds the client half and, like `frontend.js`,
touches no DOM so it tests in node. A play is recorded when a desktop player
takes pointer lock or a touch player deploys. Social-card scrapers and bounced
tabs never reach it; the automation harness enters through `setAutomationActive`
without counting a play, and the mobile harness uses a local counter stub. The first
record per page session latches, so resuming from the pause menu does not count
again. New-versus-returning is a `vibeslops:player` key in `localStorage` —
clearing site data counts you again, which is unavoidable without asking
anonymous players to sign in.

The server half is `netlify/functions/plays.mjs`, on Netlify Blobs. Both counts
live under one key so a reader cannot catch the pair mid-update, and the
increment is a compare-and-swap against the entry's ETag with a short retry
ladder: Blobs has no atomic add, and a plain read-modify-write would silently
drop a count whenever two players started at the same moment.

The counter is decoration and fails silently — offline, blocked, or served by
the static dev server above, which has no function and simply 404s, the line
stays blank rather than breaking the frontend. There is no "am I in production"
check, so `netlify dev` exercises the real thing against its own local blob
store:

```powershell
npx netlify dev
```

`netlify.toml` exists only to name the publish and functions directories; it
restates the `export/web` the site already served, since a `netlify.toml`
overrides the Netlify UI's settings.

### Bandwidth

Nothing heavy is fetched until the page sees a pointer move, key press, wheel
or touch. A visit that never gets that far costs about 2.6 MB; one that plays
costs about 47 MB. The gate exists because the account went over its Netlify
bandwidth limit twice on traffic that was not players: the play counter read
867 plays all-time while September burned 125 GB in two days, so the bytes were
going to crawlers, link previews and people who bounced off the title screen.
Shrinking the files (`.tools/prune-deploy.sh`, the ETC1S re-bake) had already
been tried and was not enough on its own.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Automation must either send input or opt out with `?autostart=1`. Desktop
  smoke checks opt out; `ai:mobile` tests the welcome prompt and sends a real
  touch before the game modules finish loading, then verifies startup completes
  with exactly one map download. Early visitor input is remembered while scripts load.
- Only the equipped rifle loads at boot. The other eight are fetched when the
  class screen opens, so scripted runs that select a rifle directly need
  `await hijacked.debug.loadAllWeapons()` first.

`export/web/_headers` caches art for a week and leaves the baked map set
revalidating, because the .glb, the collision BVH, the navmesh and the probes
are baked together and have to stay in step. Pinning them needs content-hashed
filenames first. `export/web/robots.txt` keeps crawlers off the asset tree.

## First-person viewmodel

The viewer renders selectable M27/HK416 and AN-94 weapon viewmodels with FBI
shortsleeve viewhands in a dedicated depth-cleared pass so they never clip into
walls. Press `1` for the M27 or `2` for the AN-94. The rigs come from the game
export (`export_chars/model_export/`,
`export_common/model_export/`, see `EXPORTING_ASSETS.md`); the copies served to
the browser live in `export/web/viewmodel/`. The weapon is mounted by aligning
its `j_gun` joint to the hands' `tag_weapon` joint, and the whole rig is
anchored at `tag_view` with the engine view axes (X forward, Z up) mapped to
the camera. It includes look sway, walk bob, a sprint pose, and hold-right-
mouse ADS, which rotates the gun square to the view axis and seats the eye
7 units behind `tag_sights` for a proper iron-sight picture.

Both rifles fire automatic camera-centered hitscan rounds against the collision
scene. The AN-94 uses its native 40 damage, 625 RPM sustained cadence, and
937.5 RPM two-round hyperburst. Shots use each rifle's authored hip/ADS fire
animations and include view recoil, a `tag_flash` muzzle flash, each rifle's own
player-shot sample over the shared decay/LFE layers, tracers, persistent impact
marks, a 30-round magazine, and eight reserve magazines. Every respawn restores the full
`30/240` life loadout.

Rounds that connect raise a hitmarker on the crosshair: white for a body hit,
gold for a head hit, and a longer-lived red marker for a kill. Each is paired
with a short synthesized tick — the extracted banks carry no UI alias — routed
around the gunfire compressor so the confirmation is not ducked by the shot
that earned it.

## Free for all

The browser runs a seven-combatant free-for-all: the player and six named PLA
bots, first to 30 kills or the leader after five minutes. The match HUD shows
score, time, placement, and a kill feed; holding `Tab` opens the full standings.
Death keeps the fight visible behind a killer/respawn card, then selects a safe
authored `mp_dm_spawn`, restores the loadout, and grants brief spawn protection.

Six PLA assault enemies spawn across the map's authored FFA markers and
move with the baked Detour crowd. They patrol, acquire the player through
field-of-view and collision-based line-of-sight checks, pursue, fire, remember
the last seen position, search nearby navigation points after losing contact,
die, and respawn. Bots use the same perception and damage paths against every
other living combatant, so bot-versus-bot kills count in the standings. Every
enemy with visibility and a clear firing line can shoot; individual reaction
delays, bursts, reloads, movement-sensitive
accuracy, suppression, and tactical repositioning keep the fight readable
without an artificial attacker cap. The browser uses the exported PLA
body, M27 world model, and converted `pb_*` body animations, with separate
head, torso, and leg damage zones.

The HUD is drawn with the game's own art (`export/web/ui/hud/`, dumped by
`.tools/export_hud.py`; layout rebuilt in `export/web/hud.js` since T6 HUD
menudefs do not dump): a rotating radar minimap built on the
`compass_map_mp_hijacked` radar texture with firing-enemy pings, the compass
tape, and the digit-based ammo counter. Health reads through the low-health
vignette and damage flash rather than a bar, as in the game.

The rifle rides `tag_weapon_right`, the body's own weapon socket, the same way
the viewmodel welds `j_gun` to the hands' `tag_weapon`. Two details do not come
free. The stance clips have to be the weapon set (`pb_stand_alert`,
`pb_combatrun_forward_loop`); the `pb_hold_*` set is T6's carry stance, which
poses the hands for an object and parks the socket somewhere unrelated. And the
clips and the PLA rig disagree about the socket offset — the clips put it about
14 inches from the wrist, the model's bind 11.4 — so the socket is calibrated
once per stance against the authored trigger hand, which lands the grip within
about a sixth of an inch of the wrist. `pb_death_faceplant` animates the
socket 30 inches clear of the body because T6 drops the weapon on death, so the
falling body instead keeps the rifle welded to its trigger hand.

Enemy fire is audible and locatable. Every shot lights a pooled additive sprite
at the shooter's `tag_flash` and plays a panned report through an HRTF
`PannerNode` whose distances are tuned to Radiant inches, with a distance-driven
lowpass standing in for air absorption. The export ships only the
player-perspective M27 alias, so that report is derived from it rather than
sampled from a true `_npc` variant; extracting those from `mpl_common` would
replace the filtering with the authored sound. The flashes are deliberately
unlit sprites — a `PointLight` per shot would recompile every material it
reached, undoing the load-time shader warm-up.

## Rebuild collision and navigation

Python 3 is required. The scene composer also runs the collision exporter:

```powershell
python .tools/compose_scene.py
npm run bake:map
npm run bake:collision
npm run bake:navmesh
```

The first command rebuilds the source render scene, collision-only glTF, and
spawn/pathnode navigation hints. The bake commands then create the optimized
render GLB, collision BVH, and serialized Recast navmesh loaded by the browser.
`bake:map` requires Khronos KTX-Software's `ktx` executable on `PATH`.

Generated runtime assets are in `export/web`:

- `hijacked.gltf` / `hijacked.bin`: visible map
- `hijacked_collision.gltf` / `.bin`: physics-only geometry
- `hijacked_optimized.glb`: Meshopt/KTX2 runtime render map
- `hijacked_collision_bvh.bin` / `.json`: runtime collision BVH
- `hijacked_nav_hints.json`: spawns, pathnodes, and traversal links
- `hijacked.navmesh.bin` / `.json`: baked Recast mesh and build metadata

The collision export combines filtered BSP render surfaces with each placed
xmodel's authored `collLod`. The extracted game files do not include usable T6
clipmap/physics brushes, so this is a close geometry-derived approximation
rather than the original engine collision.

## Tests

Run fast collision and navmesh tests with:

```powershell
npm run test:unit
```

With the localhost server running on port 8000, run the Chrome/Edge smoke test:

```powershell
npm run test:browser
```

`npm test` runs both sets.

## AI visual testing

The repository includes a Playwright harness that gives coding agents both a
rendered view of the game and a JSON snapshot of its internal state. It starts
its own local server and headless Chrome/Edge, so no manual setup is required:

```powershell
npm run ai:state
npm run ai:screenshot
npm run ai:test
npm run ai:enemy
npm run ai:life
npm run ai:mobile
npm run ai:graphics
npm run ai:graphics -- fallback
npm run ai:record -- 10
```

Outputs are written to `artifacts/ai-game/`:

- `before.png` and `screenshot.png`: visual before/after evidence
- `before-state.json` and `state.json`: player, weapon, enemy, overlay, and
  renderer state
- `console.log`: browser console, page, and network failures
- `trace.zip`: a Playwright trace with screenshots and DOM snapshots
- `recording.webm`: video produced by `ai:record`
- `report.json`: machine-readable checks and pass/fail status

`ai:mobile` writes to `artifacts/ai-mobile/`. It tests simultaneous touch
contacts, action buttons, interruption recovery, class selection, and match
restart, with screenshots at phone and tablet sizes in both orientations.

`ai:graphics` writes to `artifacts/ai-graphics/`. It checks rendering presets,
high-density phone buffers, portrait/tablet resizing, persistence, and held
touch input across resolution changes. `fallback` simulates unavailable HDR
multisampling to verify the FXAA path. Use `AI_GAME_ARTIFACT_DIR` to retain both
runs separately. These software-rendered checks verify behavior and visuals;
real-device frame rates and battery use need phone measurements.
Set `AI_GAME_MOBILE=1` with `npm run ai:record -- 10 m27` to record the mobile
rendering path at a high-density phone viewport.

Set `AI_GAME_HEADED=1` to watch the controlled browser. `BROWSER_TEST_URL` can
point the harness at an existing server, and `BROWSER_PATH` can select a custom
Chrome/Edge executable.

At runtime, `globalThis.hijacked.debug` provides a stable automation surface:
`getState`, `setActive`, `pause`, `resume`, `teleportPlayer`, `lookAt`, overlay
toggles, `selectWeapon`, damage/respawn controls, and enemy reset. Keep this
surface stable when changing runtime internals because tests and coding agents
depend on it.
